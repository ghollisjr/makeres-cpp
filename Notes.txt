* Lisp conversion to C++ works ok for things representable as strings,
  but for e.g. histograms it might be better to have them available in
  files.  Modifying makeres & logres to automatically log results once
  they're computed might need to be done prior to finishing
  makeres-cpp.  This way results will be available in a standard
  format for makeres-cpp to access.

  1. ROOT histograms will be used for C++ histogram support, reading
     and writing of ROOT histograms from HDF5 files will be necessary,

  2. ROOT histograms come in 4 flavors: TH1, TH2, TH3, and sparse (no
     one should use THn without being sparse)

  3. C++ needs to know which type of histogram to use, so the Lisp
     forms for the C++ must support encoding this information via
     checking the dimensionality of required histograms and using this
     information to generate the ROOT histogram type.
